It's an ADC DPS tracker!
This module is designed to calculate ideal DPS (including skill damage, passives, items, etc.)
as well as let the user see their output in less than ideal situations (you can't attack when stunned or running, for example)
and against various levels of defense stats.

Currently, it's not working (user interface is to come).
I'm focusing on getting the theoretical model for champions done one at a time.
I'll be adding features to Tracker.py to make a friendly interface as soon as I get a chance and learn PyGui.
I'll also be updating this README to comply with Markdown and to have a complete list of features and usage when I get a chance.
If you have a feature/champion request, please e-mail me at gprinziv@gmail.cm and I'll see what I can do!
